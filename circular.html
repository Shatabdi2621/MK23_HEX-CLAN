    <h2>Insurance Sector</h2>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <p>The insurance sector is made up of companies that offer risk management in the form of insurance contracts. The basic concept of insurance is that one party, the insurer, will guarantee payment for an uncertain future event. Meanwhile, another party, the insured or the policyholder, pays a smaller premium to the insurer in exchange for that protection on that uncertain future occurrence.</p>
                <p>As an industry, insurance is regarded as a slow-growing, safe sector for investors. This perception is not as strong as it was in the 1970s and 1980s, but it is still generally true when compared to other financial sectors.  </p>

    <h2>Banking Sector</h2>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <p>The largest and the oldest bank which is still in existence is the State Bank of India (S.B.I). It originated and started working as the Bank of Calcutta in mid-June 1806. In 1809, it was renamed as the Bank of Bengal. This was one of the three banks founded by a presidency government, the other two were the Bank of Bombay in 1840 and the Bank of Madras in 1843. The three banks were merged in 1921 to form the Imperial Bank of India, which upon India's independence, became the State Bank of India in 1955. For many years the presidency banks had acted as quasi-central banks, as did their successors, until the Reserve Bank of India[5] was established in 1935, under the Reserve Bank of India Act</p>

    <h2> Sector</h2>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <p>There are three major components to the Indian  system: the civil servants , the mandatory  programs run by the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation of India, and the unorganised sector  called the National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP).[1]

The State of Uttar Pradesh has implemented E- system which allows filling up of  forms, checking, verification and payment using an online system.[2]

The National  System (NPS) is a voluntary defined contribution  system administered and regulated by the  Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), created by an Act of the Parliament of India. The NPS started with the decision of the Government of India to stop defined benefit s for all its employees who joined after 1 January 2004. While the scheme was initially designed for government employees only, it was opened up for all citizens of India in 2009. NPS is an attempt by the government to create a ed society in India.[3]</p>
